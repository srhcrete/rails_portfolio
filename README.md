# Planning the application

1. What am I building? I am building a personal site.  A place where I can blog, share examples of my work, and have people contact me.
2. Who am I building it for? I am building this for myself, but also for the community as a place where people can see my work and see what I'm learning. This is a great way to learn for myself, but also teach others in the process. This will show potential employers what I know.
3.  What features do I want to have? As an admin, I want to be able to CRUD skills, projects, and Blog entries. Use ActionMailer to send automated emails if clients try to contact me. Use paperclip for photos and pdfs.
